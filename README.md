### [Jump Game](jump/)
A side-scrolling arcade game inspired by the Chrome offline dinosaur game. Players choose their character - a dinosaur, unicorn, or hamster - and jump over obstacles to get the highest score.

### [Puzzle Game](puzzle/)
A jigsaw-style puzzle game where kids drag and drop pieces to complete pictures. Multiple images and difficulty levels to keep things interesting.

### [Labyrinth Game](labyrinth/)
Navigate through a maze to reach the goal. Tilt-friendly controls on mobile, arrow keys on desktop. Randomly generated mazes so every game is different.
