# Simplespil

Simple offline games for kids - no ads, no internet required, just fun.

## Games

### Jump Game
A side-scrolling arcade game inspired by the Chrome offline dinosaur game. Players choose their character - a dinosaur, unicorn, or hamster - and jump over obstacles to get the highest score.

### Puzzle Game
A jigsaw-style puzzle game where kids drag and drop pieces to complete pictures. Multiple images and difficulty levels to keep things interesting.

### Labyrinth Game
Navigate through a maze to reach the goal. Tilt-friendly controls on mobile, arrow keys on desktop. Randomly generated mazes so every game is different.

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in any browser - that's it. No server, no install, no internet needed. Works on phones, tablets, and computers.

## Tech

Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no build steps, no dependencies. Everything runs in the browser offline.
